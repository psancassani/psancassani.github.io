I am a PhD student at ifo Institut at the Department of Economics of Education and LMU in Munich, Germany.

My research interests are **Education**, **Labor**, and **Political Economics**.\
I am currently working on understanding how politicians' debates respond to an increase in the **salience of a topic**, on how **cultural factors** affect student achievement, and on the impact of **teacher characteristics** on student achievement.\
In my research, I combine **econometric techniques** with the analysis of **text data** and **machine learning** algorithms. I have undertaken the collection of parliamentary debates and data from social media.

* Topic Salience and Political Polarization: Evidence from the German “PISA-Shock” - [Draft](https://psancassani.github.io/files/draft_topic_salience.pdf)
	* Abstract: How does the salience of a topic affect the polarization in parliamentary debates about the same topic? Using parliamentary debates from the 16 German state parliaments, I exploit the exogenous increase in the salience of education induced by the unexpectedly low performance of German students in the PISA 2000 test—the German “PISA-shock”. In a difference-in-differences design, I find that the “PISA-shock” caused a 8.8% of a standard deviation increase in polarization of education debates compared to debates on other topics. The effect is long-lasting and fades after about 6 years. It is also homogenous with respect to the average performance of each German state, despite the large differences highlighted by PISA. I also find that the increase in polarization is accompanied by an increase in the number of proposed bills about education. Finally, I provide suggestive evidence on the education issues that led to an increase in polarization.

* The Effect of Teacher Subject-Specific Qualifications on Student Science Achievement - [Link to paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537122001993?via%3Dihub),[Final Version](https://psancassani.github.io/files/final_verison_science_teachers.pdf)
	* *Labor Economics*, Volume 80, 2023, 102309
	* Abstract: I investigate the effect of teacher subject-specific qualifications on student science achievement using data from TIMSS 2015, a large-scale assessment of student skills. I exploit the availability of student test scores in four different science subjects—biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science—to test whether teachers holding a subject-specific qualification raise student test scores. Using a within-student within-teacher approach, which controls for student and teacher heterogeneity, I find that teacher subject-specific qualification in one subject increases student test scores by 3.5% of a standard deviation in the same subject. The effect is stronger for female students, especially when they are taught by female teachers, for disadvantaged students, and in lower-performing countries. The mediation analysis reveals that 20% of the effect is explained by teachers feeling more confident to teach topics in subjects in which they hold subject-specific qualifications.


* The Effect of Teacher Characteristics on Students’ Science Achievement - [ifo Working Paper No. 348](https://www.ifo.de/DocDL/wp-2021-348-sancassani-science-teachers.pdf), [Blog Post](https://international-education.blog/en/the-more-experienced-the-moreboring/?cn-reloaded=1)
	* Abstract: Using data from TIMSS 2015, an international large-scale assessment of student skills, I investigate the effect of teacher characteristics on students’ science achievement. My identification strategy exploits the feature that in many education systems different science domains (physics, biology, chemistry, and earth science) are taught by different teachers. The availability of students’ test scores as well as teachers’ questionnaires for each of these domains allows me to implement a within-student approach which controls for unobserved student heterogeneity. I find a positive and significant effect of teacher specialization in the specific science domain on students’ results, equivalent to 1.7% of a standard deviation. Holding a Master’s degree, pedagogical preparation and teaching experience have no significant effect. Teachers’ experience has a negative impact on the extent to which students like to study a subject or find teaching engaging.
