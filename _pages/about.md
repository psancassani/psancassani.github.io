I am a PhD student at ifo Institut at the Department of Economics of Education and LMU in Munich, Germany.

My research interests are **Education**, **Labor**, and **Political Economics**.\
I am currently working on understanding how politicians' debates respond to an increase in the **salience of a topic**, on how **cultural factors** affect student achievement, and on the impact of **teacher characteristics** on student achievement.\
In my research, I combine **econometric techniques** with the analysis of **text data** and **machine learning** algorithms. I have undertaken the collection of parliamentary debates and data from social media.

* Topic Salience and Political Polarization: Evidence from the German “PISA-Shock” - *Draft available upon request* 
	* Abstract: Does topic salience affect political polarization? On the one hand, parties might converge towards the median voter platform when a topic becomes more relevant for voters. On the other hand, parties might drift apart from each other to realign with their voters, thus following a cleavage pattern. In this paper, I investigate the impact of topic salience on the polarization of political debates about education in Germany. I exploit the exogenous increase in the salience of education induced by the "PISA-shock", the release of the first results of the PISA study in December 2001. Using parliamentary debates of all German state parliaments, I provide evidence of an increase in polarization due to the "PISA-shock", in line with parties following a cleavage pattern to gain electoral consensus. The effect is larger for parties for which education is a more salient topic. The large heterogeneity in the performance of German states revealed in June 2002 is not accompanied by a heterogeneous effect on polarization. This result suggests that topic salience, rather than the actual information shock, drives the effect on polarization.


* The Effect of Teacher Subject-Specific Qualifications on Student Science Achievement - *Draft available upon request*
	* Revise & Resubmit, Labor Economics
	* Abstract: I investigate the effect of teacher subject-specific qualifications on student science achievement using data from TIMSS 2015, a large-scale assessment of student skills. I exploit the availability of student test scores in four different science subjects—biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science—to test whether teachers holding a subject-specific qualification raise student test scores. Using a within-student within-teacher approach, which controls for student and teacher heterogeneity, I find that teacher subject-specific qualification in one subject increases student test score by 3.5% of a standard deviation in the same subject. The effect is stronger for female students, especially when they are taught by female teachers, for disadvantaged students, and in lower-performing countries. The mediation analysis reveals that up to 21% of the effect is explained by teachers feeling more confident to teach topics in subjects in which they hold subject-specific qualifications.


* The Effect of Teacher Characteristics on Students’ Science Achievement - [ifo Working Paper No. 348](https://www.ifo.de/DocDL/wp-2021-348-sancassani-science-teachers.pdf), [Blog Post](https://international-education.blog/en/the-more-experienced-the-moreboring/?cn-reloaded=1)
	* Abstract: Using data from TIMSS 2015, an international large-scale assessment of student skills, I investigate the effect of teacher characteristics on students’ science achievement. My identification strategy exploits the feature that in many education systems different science domains (physics, biology, chemistry, and earth science) are taught by different teachers. The availability of students’ test scores as well as teachers’ questionnaires for each of these domains allows me to implement a within-student approach which controls for unobserved student heterogeneity. I find a positive and significant effect of teacher specialization in the specific science domain on students’ results, equivalent to 1.7% of a standard deviation. Holding a Master’s degree, pedagogical preparation and teaching experience have no significant effect. Teachers’ experience has a negative impact on the extent to which students like to study a subject or find teaching engaging.
